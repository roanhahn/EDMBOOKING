							Have you heard? One of our camping artists has already been announced: Nicky Romero will be headlining our pre-party on Friday. The pre-party will be a musical adventure of 12 full hours on 5 different stages! Starting at 14h sharp, we invite you to get in the mood for our unforgettable weekend. On Saturday night, all camping guests exclusively get access to our after-party as well as to the silent disco on the camping grounds. The full camping line up will be released at the end of March. Keep your eyes on our socials!

						<p>
							As the only visitors on Friday, our camping guests will get an exclusive taste of Mysteryland earlier than everyone else. Starting on Friday afternoon, the pre-party lasts 12 full hours on 6 stages and includes a food truck plaza, plenty of space to chill out, and lots of little corners to dance, and make new friends. On Saturday night, the festival officially closes at 23h, but not for our camping guests, cause the afterparty won’t stop until the early hours of Sunday morning!
